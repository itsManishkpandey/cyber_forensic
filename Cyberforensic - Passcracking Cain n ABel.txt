Aim: Password Cracking using Cain and Abel.

This exercise demonstrates how password could be cracked through 		various methods, specifically regarding MD5 encrypted passwords
Part 1: Dictionary attack - Dictionary attack uses a predetermined list 
of 	words from a dictionary to generate possible passwords that may
 match 	the MD5 encrypted password. This is one of the easiest and 
quickest way to obtain any given password.

Step 1: Start Cain & Abel via the Desktop Shortcut ‘Cain’ or Start menu .
 	a. (Start > Programs > Cain > Cain).

Step 2: Choose ‘Yes’ to proceed when a ‘User Account Control’ 
		notification pops up regarding software authorization
Step 3: Once on, select the ‘Cracker’ tab with the key symbol, 
then click 	on MD5 Hashes. The result should look like the image below.
Step 4: As you might have noticed we don’t have any passwords to crack,
 thus for the next few steps we will create our own MD5 encrypted passwords. 
First, locate the Hash Calculator among a row of icons near the top. Open it.
Step 5: Next, type into ‘Text to Hash’ the word password. It will generate a 
list of hashes pertaining to different types of hash algorithms. We will be 
focusing on MD5 hash so copy it. Then exit calculator by clicking ‘Cancel’
Step 6: After you exit, right click and select ‘Add to list’ , paste your hash
then click OK . Your first encrypted password! But don’t stop there, add the 
following MD5 hashes from the words PaSS , 13579, 15473 , sunshine89, and c@t69
Step 7:  With all the encrypted MD5 passwords on hand, we can finally start! 
Move your cursor and select all six passwords, then right click and press
 ‘Dictionary Attack’. 
Step 8: Once the window opens, go up to the dictionary and select ‘Wordlist.txt’ , right click and select ‘Reset initial file position’. You’ll know you’ve resetted when there’s nothing under the position column. Note: Make sure to do this every time you want to 
restart a dictionary attack!
Step 9: Click ‘start’ and watch the magic happens before your eyes! Once it ends ‘exit’ . 
Your result should be the same as below.

Part 2 : Rainbow Tables - Rainbow tables use pre­calculated MD5 hashes sorted 
on a 	table(s) to compare to encrypted MD5 files in order to find a match 
thus cracking the 	password. This type of
 password cracking trades time and storage capacity.
***************************

Step 1: Continuation from the previous ‘Dictionary Attack’ section. 
Cain & Abel should 	already be 
opened with following MD5 encrypted passwords.
Step 2: Now with the other half of the passwords still encrypted, 
we will be using rainbow table attacking to see if we can finally crack them.
 Select all six passwords, right click, 
and select ‘Cryptanalysis Attack via RainbowTables’.
Step 3: A window will pop up and you could see under ‘Sorted Rainbow Tables’ 
there is already a MD5 rainbow table already added. Notice the specifications 
for that specific rainbow table. Click ‘Start’ when ready. ‘Exit’ when done.

Part 3: Brute Force - Brute force attacks uses a finite but enormous number 
of combinations involving alphabet, numbers, and symbols in order to crack a 
password. This type of password cracking is usually used as a last resort as 
it’s the most time consuming overall.
******

Step 1: Continuation from the previous ‘Rainbow Tables’ section. Cain & Abel 
should already be opened with the following MD5 encrypted passwords.
Step 2: Now with only two more passwords still encrypted, we will be using 
brute force attack to see if we can finally crack them. Select all six 
passwords, right click, and select ‘Brute­Force Attack’.
Step 3 : Once a window appears we will have to adjust some settings to fit our 
requirements. Under Charset and Predefined selected, 
open the drop down bar and select 	the one below the initially selected 
one. Next, under Password length turn Max down to 5. 
Step 4: When ready click ‘Start’. Once it’s done calculating ‘Exit’ . Your 
final results should be the same as below. All of them should be cracked!
 Yay!
